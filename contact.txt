Hi,

I'm Christopher Bero, a computer engineering student at UAH.

My senior design team is pursuing the development of several low cost computer interface devices to test the feasibility of bringing adaptive technology to more people.

We'd like to collaborate with local organizations to test and refine these tools. If this is something the UCP is interested in, we would love to hear back and schedule some meetings to move forward with the designs.

Thank you,

Chris
