### Problem Statement

Computers have dropped in price, grown in capability, and leapt into consumer markets in the past few years. Adaptive Technologies (AT) which help persons living with disability interface with a computer have been left behind in this regard. Solutions available are expensive and difficult to obtain. There is a distinct need for human interface devices which meet many AT requirements and are available to wider audiences for more reasonable cost.

### Project Objective Statement

Create and study affordable AT that can be crowdsourced and brought to people who currently can't access it.

### Marketing Requirements

* **Open Source Design**
    * Make design condusive to materials and tools available to makerspaces.
    * Put extra effort in to make the device easy to customize and iterate upon.
    * Use low cost machinery and materials.
* **Easy to Operate**
    * Must provide as good or better functionality than commercial equivalent.
    * Should be decently portable.
* **Reliable**
    * Must accept all possible input.
    * Must have a robust mechanical design.

### Engineering Requirements

* **Hardware bounce time during activation:** <6ms
* **10 Million cycle lifetime.**
* **User Operation**
    * 30 Words per minute
    * 90% Typing accuracy
* **Materials**
    * Thermoplastics -- Case, Mounts
    * Stainless Steel -- Springs, Case
    * Gold Alloy -- Switch Contacts
* **PCB**
    * PCB should be at most 2-layer.
    * PCB should be dispersed enough in design to be easily fabricated with laserjet/home solutions.

### Constraints and Standards

#### Constraints

* **Target Price Point:** <$150
* **Portability**
	* Should be straightforward to move.
* **2-Layer PCB Designs**
    * More complicated impelmentations remove the prospect of home manufacturing.

#### Standards

* **USB HID Profiling**
	* Must be recognized as an interface device.
	* USB standard 1.1 or 2.0.
* **3.5mm Mono Jack**
	* Used in a multitude of existing AT interface systems.
