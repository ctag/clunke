### Project Status

- Attempted to contact organizations that are relevant to our product for testing and feedback (UCP NFB UAH DSS ADIB).
- We have gotten response from UCP and UAHDSS.
- Prepared purchasing guidelines for prototype materials.
- Gave project presentation to the class.
- Updated scope of projected, adjusted long term goals in case of difficulty.

### Difficulties Encountered

Firmly establishing contact has been slower than anticipated. The biggest criticism from the presentation was our lack of contact with potential customers. We have increased efforts of contact, with mixed results.

### Next Sprint

For the next reporting period we intend to:

-Begin investigation into the software aspect of the project.
-Order materials for construction of the prototype.
-Assess any changes to project details based on presentation.
