### Project Status

Since the course launch, we have:

- Formed a team
- Reviewed candidate projects.
- Selected a project for milestone 1 attempt.
- Begun initial research on necessary background and design.


### Difficulties Encountered

As a team we've struggled to decide on a primary project. After several iterative reviews we've adjusted the initial keyboard project to increase scope of research and design.


### Next Sprint

For the next reporting period we intend to

- Complete and present a project proposal.
- Continue research on hardware and software design requirements.
- Begin construction of a parts list for hardware designs.
- Triage hardware designs to choose a spearhead for milestone 1's prototype.
- Begin setup of a hardware workbench to include a machine with adaptive programs installed for testing.
