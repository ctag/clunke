### Project Status
<!---
Project Status is a review of what was accomplished last week and a description of where we stand going into this sprint. A comparison between goals and actual accomplishments is a good idea.
-->

We are working on our topical presentation, we will discuss the prospective future of consumer 3d printing with the class as well as the tests and findings we obtained through operation of our own printer.

Current goal is to design and upload a website detailing our project's goals and progress. 

We outlined our individual short term goals for this semester. 

### Difficulties Encountered

<!---
Difficulties Encountered is required. Other teams report losing points if this is missing.
Put here any trouble we had while accomplishing work during the previous sprint/week.
-->

Continual time conflicts create delays in our group meetings. Additionally, we have continued to encounter issues with scheduling within the course, as there does not seem to be a central calendar where class times and locations are posted.

### Next Sprint

<!---
Next Sprint should be a list of tasks that each member is going to work towards for the upcomming week.
Make sure to email members on Thursday or Friday so that they can respond with their most recent progress.
