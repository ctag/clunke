### Project Status
<!---
Project Status is a review of what was accomplished last week and a description of where we stand going into this sprint. A comparison between goals and actual accomplishments is a good idea.
-->

We are working on our topical presentation, we will discuss the prospective future of consumer 3d printing with the class as well as the tests and findings we obtained through operation of our own printer.

The firmware is prepared for another keyboard prototype, which will have components laser cut on the 26th and 3d printed on the 27th. We need more mx switches for prototyping, a purchase order is being assembled, will likely be sent next week.

### Difficulties Encountered

<!---
Difficulties Encountered is required. Other teams report losing points if this is missing.
Put here any trouble we had while accomplishing work during the previous sprint/week.

Continual time conflicts create delays in our group meetings. 

### Next Sprint

<!---
Next Sprint should be a list of tasks that each member is going to work towards for the upcomming week.
Make sure to email members on Thursday or Friday so that they can respond with their most recent progress.
