### Project Status

This week we were able to schedule a meeting with our customer, UCP. We will be meeting with an Assistive Technology Specialist. While meeting with the customer is our primary concern for the time being, some progress has also been made on software development. We are currently researching existing software for text prediction which can be used to increase functionality of both our product hopefully existing products already owned and used.


### Difficulties Encountered

We are still trying to find a Project Director to meet the requirements for our two team members who are in the Honors College.
Prior to the meeting we have planned with UCP we have had no face-to-face contact with any of our customers yet which has severely hindered our understanding of our customerâ€™s needs. This meeting should help resolve this hurdle.


### Next Sprint

For the next reporting period we intend to do the following:

Meet with UCP and finalize our initial requirements on our hardware.
Begin building a prototype input device.
Continue research and begin trying various open source software applications which predict the intended completion of a fragment of a word.
