### Project Status
<!---
Project Status is a review of what was accomplished last week and a description of where we stand going into this sprint. A comparison between goals and actual accomplishments is a good idea.
-->

We have met and continued work on redesigning the keyboard. Things are slowed somewhat by midterms.

### Difficulties Encountered

<!---
Difficulties Encountered is required. Other teams report losing points if this is missing.
Put here any trouble we had while accomplishing work during the previous sprint/week.
-->

We're still reviewing the feedback from our customer meeting. Pivoting the keyboard demo we made to a useable test piece will likely require modifying the PVC components, and we're still following up on the best route to do this.

### Next Sprint

<!---
Next Sprint should be a list of tasks that each member is going to work towards for the upcomming week.
Make sure to email members on Thursday or Friday so that they can respond with their most recent progress.
