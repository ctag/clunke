### Project Status
<!---
Project Status is a review of what was accomplished last week and a description of where we stand going into this sprint. A comparison between goals and actual accomplishments is a good idea.
-->

We have devised a better method of constructing our keyboard from feedback during our customer meeting. A new keyboard will be prepared and brought back to the customer.

We have a website available at http://ctag.github.io/cpe495/

### Difficulties Encountered

<!---
Difficulties Encountered is required. Other teams report losing points if this is missing.
Put here any trouble we had while accomplishing work during the previous sprint/week.
-->

A few weeks ago the Archlinux libraries used with mspdebug were updated and broke the package. Chris rebooted his laptop before meeting with our customer, and the program stopped working, which prevented us from flashing the alternate firmware to our testing keyboard. We've looked into the problem and updated the mspds AUR package to work once again.

### Next Sprint

<!---
Next Sprint should be a list of tasks that each member is going to work towards for the upcomming week.
Make sure to email members on Thursday or Friday so that they can respond with their most recent progress.
