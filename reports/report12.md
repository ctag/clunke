### Project Status
<!---
Project Status is a review of what was accomplished last week and a description of where we stand going into this sprint. A comparison between goals and actual accomplishments is a good idea.
-->

We have delivered a regurgitation of last semesters presentation, as requested. We are now spinning back up work on the second keyboard prototype and application software.

### Difficulties Encountered

<!---
Difficulties Encountered is required. Other teams report losing points if this is missing.
Put here any trouble we had while accomplishing work during the previous sprint/week.
-->

We upgraded from a 30W to 100W chemical laser bed and have had huge difficulties working with the control software. DXF if the preferred format for migrating an SVG model to the laser, but DXF files exported by Inkscape fail to be processed. We're working on an export format such as PLT or HPGL, but both crash a python script in Inscape when invoked.

### Next Sprint

<!---
Next Sprint should be a list of tasks that each member is going to work towards for the upcomming week.
Make sure to email members on Thursday or Friday so that they can respond with their most recent progress.
