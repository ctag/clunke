### Project Status

We are currently waiting feedback from our presentation in order to move forward. We are creating our purchase order and continuing our attempt to contact groups who have already done relevant research in Adaptive Technology. 


### Difficulties Encountered

Two of our team members are in the Honors College, which requires a
Project Director:
"Whether you write a thesis or do a project, you must have somebody with whom you can work closely and who is an expert in your chosen field. You may wish to work with a professor with whom you previously took a class, your major advisor, or someone with whom you have been working in a lab, studio, or in clinical practice ... Generally the director should have at least a graduate degree in her or his field, and preferably the terminal degree in the relevant field."

Difficulties include finding a person that fits this criteria.


### Next Sprint

For the next reporting period we intend to

- Continue research on hardware and software design requirements.
- Triage hardware designs to choose a spearhead for milestone 1's prototype.
- Begin setup of a hardware workbench to include a machine with adaptive programs installed for testing.
