### Project Status
<!---
Project Status is a review of what was accomplished last week and a description of where we stand going into this sprint. A comparison between goals and actual accomplishments is a good idea.
-->

We have gotten some firmware bugs ironed out during the winter break, the predictive application is undergoing some review of target platforms and database systems.

The team will break from work on the project to prepare a regurgitation of the previous semesters presentation that's been requested.

### Difficulties Encountered

<!---
Difficulties Encountered is required. Other teams report losing points if this is missing.
Put here any trouble we had while accomplishing work during the previous sprint/week.
-->

We are interested in doing most of the prototyping via chemical laser beds due to the speed and cost effective iteration, but some aspects of the prototype keyboard in our design result in weak joints and poor movement. We need to look into either kickstarting the 3d printing early or working with better resolution models on the laser.

### Next Sprint

<!---
Next Sprint should be a list of tasks that each member is going to work towards for the upcomming week.
Make sure to email members on Thursday or Friday so that they can respond with their most recent progress.
