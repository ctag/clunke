### Project Status
<!---
Project Status is a review of what was accomplished last week and a description of where we stand going into this sprint. A comparison between goals and actual accomplishments is a good idea.
-->

We are working to use the feedback provided at our last customer meeting to deliver another iteration of our prototype keyboard, along with an AT button to use with standardized 3.5mm cables found in many adaptive toys and machines.

### Difficulties Encountered

<!---
Difficulties Encountered is required. Other teams report losing points if this is missing.
Put here any trouble we had while accomplishing work during the previous sprint/week.
-->

Our 3D printer has developed a problem where the filament we have will swell slightly in some areas and bind inside of the hotend's mount. This causes us to lose the active print, as plastic stops extruding, and to recover we have to tear down the printer's extruder and remove the stuck filament.

### Next Sprint

<!---
Next Sprint should be a list of tasks that each member is going to work towards for the upcomming week.
Make sure to email members on Thursday or Friday so that they can respond with their most recent progress.
