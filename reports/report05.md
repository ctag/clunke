### Adaptive H.I.D.

* *Christopher Bero*
* Bryant Johnson
* John Gould
* Michael Baldwin

### Project Status

This sprint we conducted a meeting to gather ideas and questions in anticipation of our meeting with UCP. On November 5th we met with Kate Moseley of TASC to receive a presentation on AT systems and initial design feedback for our project.

We've also received our first shipment of hardware to begin building the sliding keyboard prototype. 

### Difficulties Encountered

Coordinating team meetings and efforts through this semesters class schedule of 431/434/435/412 has proved troublesome. We will begin implementing an hour sign off sheet for the next sprint to increase our cohesion with the group's timeline.

### Next Sprint

Tentatively:

* Christopher Bero
	* Get set up with microcontroller hardware and begin circuit designs for sliding keyboard.
* John Gould
	* Work with Christopher Bero and Michael Baldwin to make sure the initial hardware and software systems are compatible from a systems view.
* Bryant Johnson
	* Continue work on tests for both hardware and software prototypes.
* Michael Baldwin
	* Finish software research and begin design phase for program MVP
