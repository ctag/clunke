Each group member will be focused on a different perspectives of the project.
Chris's primary role is the development of hardware, with a subtask of communicating with outside organizations.
Mike will be developing the software.
John will interface between the hardware and software for each system we develop.
And Bryant will be testing both the hardware and the software.

Contingency
If we lose a group member before the end of the project our plan is to reduce the number of devices we develop
from an ideal of four to an ideal of three. The responsibility of the lost member will be divided amoung the remaining
members for the rest of the course.
