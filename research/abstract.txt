Adaptive H.I.D.

Viability Review of Low Cost, Libre Adaptive 
Human Interface Devices to Modern Computers

Project

Adaptive H.I.D. is a project to scope the field of available adaptive hardware and software systems for metrics of availability, cost, and function. The gathered information will then be used in designing and implementing new open source hardware and software solutions for adaptive human interface devices. Our goal in producing new HID systems is to research the viability of low scale “home” manufacturing in disability support roles.

Design Path

We have a base case of three physical interface devices to construct: a “robust input” keyboard which removes some of the dexterity required to type, a braille input keyboard, and a refreshable braille display. The group will also pursue an advanced software package which includes recent advances in predictive text for text entry. During the second project sprint this team will reach out to multiple local organizations for assistance in testing these units. We expect and place an allowance for the base designs to change or be replaced as we receive input and feedback from these groups.

Deliverables

This project will have a set of deliverable contingent on system acceptance testing by the associated organizations. These devices and software packages will be made publicly available and individual units created by the team will be set for donation to local organizations.
