### Sprint Stories

* Install MSP430 USB toolkit. Flash initial firmware tests.

### Task Notes

While the CPE323 course offered what I feel to be a great introduction to MSP430 architecture and microcontroller programming, the lab used Ti's little studio package that gets in the way a lot. We're going to be writing our firmware in C, and I intend to use command line tools for upload and debugging. The tradeoff is more experience with better tools, but at a pretty sharp learning curve.

Right now I need to go through the half dozen specs documents and programming guides for this chip and triage them to just the ones we need to complete the assignment. This will likely be one of the hardware overviews and the standard 900 page feature guide.
